# Swiss Canton Iconfont

Serve the 26 Swiss Cantons in a simple icon font

> FYI: This ist the `gh-pages` branch. It contains the demo page which you can find [here](http://stefanzweifel.github.io/swiss-canton-iconfont/). If you search the iconfont it self, switch to the `master` branch.

## Contribution to the Demo Page

This page was quickly build to showcase the icon font in action. It's just the default jekyll theme and could need a refreshment. If you're a designer and have a creative idea on how to showcase icons, create a pull-request or let me know.
